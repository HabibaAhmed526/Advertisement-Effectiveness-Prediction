# Advertisement Effectiveness Prediction
This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of advertisements in influencing customer purchases. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling to predict whether a customer will buy a product based on various features such as pricing, promotions, and product attributes.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of user interaction data with online advertisements, containing features related to user demographics, device information, browsing behavior, and whether the user clicked on an ad. It includes categorical and numerical variables such as age, gender, time of interaction, ad category, and previous engagement metrics. The target variable indicates whether a user clicked on the advertisement (binary classification).

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   * Drop non-important features and duplicates.
   * Handle missing values if any.
   * Convert categorical variables into numerical representations if necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   * Analyze sales trends, price distributions, and promotional effects.
   * Visualize customer purchase behavior and feature correlations.
   
3. Feature Engineering:
   * Create new relevant features to improve model performance.
   * Normalize or scale numerical features if required.

4. Model Training:
   * Train a machine learning model to predict label (purchase or no purchase).
   * Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
